# CMake Template for Raylib

[Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) is nice, bare-bones library designed for game development. I tend to use it more for creative stuff, and have found it to be a nice alternative to things like [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/). I'm working with it currently to make audio visualizers.

This is a starter template I made for my own purposes, based almost entirely on [this git gist](https://gist.github.com/erikyuzwa/98305851fc6f948805a92768c7e82705).
